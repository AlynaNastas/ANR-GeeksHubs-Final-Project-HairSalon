## Getting Started with Create React App 	:dart:
Node provides the RESTful API, React provides the frontend and accesses the API, Redux for state management and Sequelize as a realtime database.

- Use of Docker to create the development environment;
- Creation of endpoints using the Express.JS framework and the application of the REST pattern;
- Application of layered architecture - model, service and controller;
- Using JSON Web Token to generate a token when logging in;
- Middleware for user token authentication to allow access to routes;
- Database connection and management with Sequelize ORM and MySQL. 



## ‚ÑπÔ∏è How It Works

- Login.
- Logout.


1. Logged Users:
     - book appointments using interactive datepicker.
     - can cancel appointments.
     - can see their own appointments.
     - can update their profile.
     - view their own profile.

2. Stylists (user role):
     - view all appointments.
     - view all costumers.
     - view their own profile.

3. Admin:
     - deletes appointments.
     - view all users of the salon (not just costumers. Including Stylist and Admins).
     - view their own profile.

4. Layouts:
     - Home
     - Services
     - Treatments
     - Reviews

> **Note**
> I would like to keep working on progress to update and create new functionalities for this app.

## Issues, solutions and future functionalities üìÜ :pushpin:

   1. Issue: I can not bring Stylist name to the front end.
        - Solution: I would need to bring data through different tables doing "joins" between the tables.

   2. Issue: Slot time date picker not functional choosing the time, I do not have the available time implemented.
        - Solution: I would need to install React Day Time Picker.

   3. Issue: As an Admin I can¬¥t delete/update users, roles.
         - Solution: I have those endpoints in the backend now we will work on them as future functionalities to be emplemented in this project.
