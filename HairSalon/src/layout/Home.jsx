          <p>Following your visit to our award-winning salon, maintain a glossy mane with shine enhancing products at home. There are a variety of professional products which will help your tresses gleam with health, lock in hydration, nourish your strands and boost colour brilliance. Investing in a professional shampoo and conditioner suited to your hair type will help retain hydration levels,
            not strip the hair of natural oils and keep any hair colour staying vibrant.
            If you have naturally frizzy hair or hair prone to humidity this can impact shine so look for smoothing products to de-frizz and smooth the cuticle. </p>
